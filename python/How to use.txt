The purpose of this script is to adapt your existing *.cfg file to be compatible with the "script.js" that reads the "cvars.js" file

1. Copy / paste the existing cvars in your *.cfg file to "gamemode_casual.cfg".

2. Open **cmd.exe** in this folder (\CS2_CFG\python\cmd.exe)

3. Copy this command and paste it into the cmd window:

python commands.py gamemode_casual.cfg formatted_cvars.js

Input file: "gamemode_casual.cfg"
Output file: "formatted_cvars.js"

4. Copy/paste the newly generated syntax-compatible cvars from your "formatted_cvars.js" to "cvars.js" to use them in a local version of this web-app
