# CS2_CFG
A web app for CS2 server operators, it generates a pretty, commented **server.cfg** file.


The CVars come from the default **gamemode_casual.cfg** configuration file that runs on fresh CS2 servers.
Included in the **python** folder is a simple script which automates the process of adapting the **gamemode_casual.cfg** file to the cvars.js format accepted by **cvars.js**.


Input your cvar values and copy / paste the output into your **server.cfg** file.
