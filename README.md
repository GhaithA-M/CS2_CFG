# CS2_CFG
CS2 **server.cfg** CVars Editor / Generator

A web app for CS2 server operators, it generates a pretty, commented **server.cfg** file.
The CVars come from the default **gamemode_competitive.cfg** configuration file that runs on fresh CS2 servers.


Just input your values and the app creates all the text you need to copy / paste into your **server.cfg** file.
You can add your own CVars in **cvars.js**.

I made this for myself, but it can prove valuable for server operators and hobbyists.
