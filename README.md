# CS2_CFG
CS2 **server.cfg** CVars Editor / Generator

A web app for CS2 server operators, it generates a pretty, commented **server.cfg** file.


The CVars come from the default **gamemode_competitive.cfg** configuration file that runs on fresh CS2 servers.

Input your cvar values and copy / paste the output into your **server.cfg** file.

You can add your own cvars in **cvars.js**.


I made this for my own use, but it can prove useful for server operators and hobbyists.
