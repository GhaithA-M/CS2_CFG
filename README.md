# CS2_CFG
CS2 "server.cfg" CVars Editor / Generator

A web app for CS2 server operators, it generates a well commented "server.cfg" file.
The CVars are based on the "gamemode_competitive.cfg" configuration file that's CS2 defaults to.

Straightforward HTML interface and CSS template, you can input your server settings easily.
Just input your values and the app creates all the text you need to copy / paste into your "server.cfg" file.

I've separated the script (script.js) from the cvars data (cvars.js) for easy maintenance.
I made this for myself, but it can prove a valuable tool for server operators and hobbyists.
